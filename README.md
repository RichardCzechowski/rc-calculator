rc-calculator
===================

<p>This element still needs to be refactored into a Bower-component because it is being used for interview purposes.</p>
<p>For now, just clone this repo and run  python -m SimpleHTTPServer</p>
<p>Optional themes on this element are 'light' and 'dark'. Add the attribute "theme='light'" to your qf-calculator element to use.</p>
